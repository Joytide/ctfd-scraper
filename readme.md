# CTFd Scraper

Just a little script that scrapes challenges and their resources in a CTFd-based CTF. (Not anything else than CTFd because they're the only framework which have an actual API) (Ok, rCTF might have something decent too but I'm lazy)

Especially useful to just run and zip a CTFd to do static challs later :)

#### Installation

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Usage

```bash
python3 ctfd_scraper.py --ctf <ctfd_url --login <username> --password <password>
```
